Absolutely! Hereâ€™s a set of **mock interview questions and answers** tailored for a **Web Developer role** â€” a mix of **frontend, backend, and full-stack** topics, including conceptual, coding, and practical real-world questions.

## ðŸ§  **Basic & Conceptual Questions**

### 1. **Whatâ€™s the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**
**Answer:**
`==` compares values after type coercion, whereas `===` compares both value and type without coercion.  
Example:  
```js
'5' == 5     // true  
'5' === 5    // false
```

---

### 2. **Explain the concept of the Virtual DOM.**
**Answer:**
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM used in libraries like React. When the state changes, a new Virtual DOM is created and compared to the previous one (diffing). Only the changed parts are updated in the real DOM, improving performance.

---

### 3. **What are RESTful APIs?**
**Answer:**
RESTful APIs follow REST architecture principles â€” stateless communication, use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and resource-based URLs.  
Example: `GET /users/1` retrieves user with ID 1.

---

### 4. **Whatâ€™s the difference between `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and `cookies`?**
**Answer:**
- `localStorage`: persists until manually cleared, ~5MB limit.
- `sessionStorage`: clears on tab close, ~5MB limit.
- `cookies`: sent with every HTTP request, used for auth/session; ~4KB limit.

---

### 5. **How do you optimize a websiteâ€™s performance?**
**Answer:**
- Lazy loading images  
- Minifying CSS/JS  
- Using CDNs  
- Caching strategies  
- Reducing API calls  
- Code splitting  
- Server-side rendering

## ðŸ§© **Coding/Logic Questions**

### 6. **Reverse a string in JavaScript**
```js
function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

---

### 7. **Create a simple API using Express.js**
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello, world!' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

---

### 8. **Write a responsive grid layout in CSS**
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ **Behavioral / Real-world Scenario Questions**

### 9. **How would you debug a broken UI after a deployment?**
**Answer:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Inspect network requests in dev tools
- Rollback to previous version (if needed)
- Check logs or monitoring dashboards
- Test in incognito to rule out cache issues
- Collaborate with QA/devops if infra-related

---

### 10. **Tell me about a web app youâ€™ve built. What tech stack did you use?**
_(Tailor this to your project â€” e.g., ValetX, Olympics Dashboard, etc.)_  
**Example Answer:**  
I built a React Native app for smart valet parking called ValetX. It uses real-time QR scanning and OCR to streamline car handovers. Backend is built in FastAPI, uses AWS for image storage, and Firebase for notifications.

---

## ðŸ§± **Frontend Tech-Specific**

### 11. **What are controlled vs uncontrolled components in React?**
**Answer:**
- Controlled: form inputs managed via state (`value={value} onChange={...}`)
- Uncontrolled: form inputs accessed via `ref`, not state-managed

---

### 12. **What is CORS and how do you handle it?**
**Answer:**
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature that restricts resource access from different origins. To handle it:
- Backend should send proper headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`)
- Use proxying in development (`vite.config.js`, `package.json`, etc.)

---

## ðŸ”§ **Backend / DevOps Related**

### 13. **How do you secure APIs?**
**Answer:**
- Use authentication (JWT, OAuth)
- Validate and sanitize inputs
- Use HTTPS
- Implement rate limiting
- Avoid exposing sensitive data

---

### 14. **How does async/await work in JavaScript?**
**Answer:**
Async functions return promises. `await` pauses execution until the promise resolves or rejects, allowing cleaner async code compared to callbacks or `.then()` chaining.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Final HR-style Qs**

### 15. **Why do you want to work as a web developer here?**
**Answer:**
I enjoy turning complex problems into intuitive web experiences. Your teamâ€™s work in [insert areaâ€”e.g., real-time systems, accessibility, etc.] aligns with my passion for building impactful applications with modern web tech.
